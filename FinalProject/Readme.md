| Criteria  |  Reqiurements  |  Related Module |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| SCM  |  Application sources should be placed in Git repository. Branching strategy should be explained. |  Git |
|  Quality gate |  CI/CD pipeline should use some quality/vulnerability control tool like a Sonar or Anchore. |  CI/CD |
|  IaC |  CI/CI and runtime infrastructure should be described as a code using Terraform, CloudFormation, or any similar tool. On the demonstration deployment procedure should be shown. |  Cloud, Terraform, Ansible |
|  Orchestration |  All non cloud-native tools should be spinned up inside a K8S/OpenShift cluster inside a cloud. Application runtime environments should be inside the cluster too. |  Kubernetes |
|  Logging |  Infrastructure should have centralized log collection/display system. Logs of the application components and infra components should be collected. |  Monitoring and Logging |
|  Monitoring |  Infrastructure should have centralized metric collection/display system. Metrics of the application components and infra components should be collected. |  Monitoring and Logging |
|  Runtime/Deployment |  Runtime infrastructure should have production and non production environments.  Deploy/release strategy should be explained. |  CI/CD |
|  Scalability/redundancy |  Scalability should be provided and demonstrated |  Kubernetes |
|  Cloud and Cost efficiency |  Cloud resources and services must be used for the task. Report about the Cloud resource usage and the cost must be provided in the presentation. It should be efficient (minimal) ‚Äì in accordance to the solving tasks. You can choose any cloud provider taking into account possible extra costs for the resources.  |  Cloud |
